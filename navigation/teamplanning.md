> The most important part of this manifesto is that we should ask other teams to review our team teach and take the constructive criticism to improve the project.

- Our team should feel comfortable to contribute ideas to the project in order to improve it.
- To complete the project deadline, we should split the project up in parts and chip away at it slowly.
- Frequent code reviews can manage goals and expectations, especially when it is done with other teams.
- Even after the project is tested and deployed, there can still be improvement areas that should be discussed and implemented.

# Forking and Versioning Plan

> Since each member has their own branch, they can make their specific changes on the same file and commit only to their branch. 
> When we feel like it's right to merge our changes, we can merge our changes from all branches into the same file

- Isolation of Changes: Each person can work on their own branch which prevents conflicts with others until all the banches are merged from. This allows for parallel development without any conflicts.

- Version Control and Collaboration: Since git keeps track of all the changes in each branch, we can review which changes are necessary and which changes aren't to make sure we have the best version possible(reviewed, discussed, and merged using pull requests).

- Conflict Management: When the four branches are merged, Git highlights any conflicts which allows us to integrate everyone's work smoothly.


> On the day of the team teach, we will make a pull request to the portfolio_2025 repo with our changes
